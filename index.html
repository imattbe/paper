        <p>The story of paper began in Egypt, with writing on papyrus, a material <i>similar</i> to thick paper from as far back as the <b>First Dynasty</b> between c. 3100 BC to c. 2900 BC. However, true papermaking began around 3000 years later in China during the Eastern Han (<span class="chinese">東漢</span>), also known as the Later Han, which began when Liu Xiu became Emperor of Guangwi of Han.</p>
