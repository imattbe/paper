        <p>The story of paper began in Egypt, with writing on papyrus, a material <i>similar</i> to thick paper from as far back as the <b>First Dynasty</b> between c. 3100 BC to c. 2900 BC. However, true papermaking began around 3000 years later in China during the Eastern Han (東漢), also known as the Later Han, which began when Liu Xiu became Emperor of Guangwi of Han.</p>
